# Miner Software README

## Features:

- **Mine up to 4 algorithms simultaneously**: Run multiple algorithms at the same time to maximize mining performance.
- **Guided setup mode**: Simple and easy-to-follow setup process for quick configuration.
- **Run in the background without a window**: Minimize the miner to run silently in the background, saving screen space.
- **Hashrate watchdog**: Monitors your mining performance and automatically restarts the miner in case of a GPU error.
- **GPU temperature monitoring**: Keeps track of your GPU's temperature and automatically shuts down the miner if the temperature gets too high.
- **System shutdown on excessive GPU temperature**: If your GPU temperature exceeds safe limits, the system will shut down to prevent hardware damage.
- **Miner auto-restart on too many rejected shares**: Automatically restarts the miner if there are too many rejected shares, ensuring consistent mining performance.
- **API for miner statistics**: Provides an API to retrieve detailed statistics about your mining session.
- **Web-based GUI interface**: Offers a user-friendly web interface to monitor miner statistics in real time.
- **Multiple pools with failover support**: Configure multiple mining pools, and the miner will automatically switch to a backup pool in case the primary one fails.
- **Difficulty monitor**: Monitors the pool's difficulty, automatically reconnecting to the pool if the difficulty is too high.
- **Job timeout monitor**: Detects job timeouts and reconnects to the pool if no job has been received for an extended period.
- **Other useful features**: A variety of additional functionalities for optimized mining performance and stability.
